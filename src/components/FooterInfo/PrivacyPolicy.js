If you purchase our products or services, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. This includes contact information such as your name, email address, and shipping address, as well as financial information such as a credit card number and its expiration date. We use the personally identifiable information that we collect for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we also will use this information to contact you. In addition, if you contact us by email through our website, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence. In any event, we reserve the right to use your email address and any other personally identifiable information that you provide to us to respond to you and to send you marketing materials for our own products and services. We will not share your information with outside parties who wish to market other products and services to you.

Alternatively, if you receive materials from us by email you can make use of the "opt out" provision in our communications so that we know that you no longer wish to receive any materials from us.

We may aggregate your information with similar data collected from other visitors to help us improve our website and the products, services, applications, content and features that we provide through our website.
